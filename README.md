Small script to take pictures when an object is detected by the phone's sensors

This is a custom script based on my phone model (google pixel 8a). It captures pictures based on data from the accelerometer of the phone, triggering a picture, saved to local memory, if an object passes in front of the phone. It also has a cooldown period and a sensitivity setting for the accelerometer so only under some conditions the picture is taken.
